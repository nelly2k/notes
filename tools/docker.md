# Docker
Docker is a lightweight, open, secure platform. Simplify building, shipping, running apps in various environments (staging, test, dev, prod). It provides shipping container system for code. 

__Image__ is a read-only template composed of layered filesystems used to share common files and create Docker container instances.

__Container__ is an isolated and secured shipping container created from an image that can be run, started, stopped, moved, and deleted.


Virtual Machine runs on top of the host operating system  and hypervisor - copy of OS for every VM, images are huge.  Containers run on top of the host operating system, but docker engine integrate them into parent OS. Having tiny image, containers start very fast.

Docker might help with versioning, "work on my machine" issue
