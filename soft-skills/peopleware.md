#  :green_book: Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams
## by Tom DeMarco

Most projects failures cannot be explained by technology, but rather has sociological reasons, they involved the teams that worked on the project. Managers in software space often don't understand their role, which is not a technology role, but mostly human communication business. 

>Managers often overlook employees' individuality, and don't leave room for necessary errors.

Managers see workers as being cogs in a machine - essentially interchangeable and uniform. The lack of consideration for human differences can only lead to poor morale.


>Mandatory overtime won't increase productivity, but lead to undertime abd higher turnover rates.

Overtime is good for final stretch, but if you sprint too long, you won't be able to finish the race.

When measuring productivity, you have to think in terms of benefit divided by cost: if you stand to benefit from saving due to unpaid overtime, then you should also consider the cost pf replacing worn-ut employees when you calculate productivity.

>Sacrificing quality for speed will make your employees less productive.

If developers constantly pressured to build lower-quality products quickly, they'll become unhappy and eventually quit their job. In contrast, workers that are happy with their work will also be more productive in the long run.

>The workplace has the highest effect on performance, so make your space a pleasure to work in.
