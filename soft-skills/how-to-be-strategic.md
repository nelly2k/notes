> A good strategy is a set of actions that is credible, coherent and focused on overcoming the biggest hurdle(s) in  achieving a particular objective. (Richard Rumlet)

- Achieving a particular objective: clear what is success look like
- Set of actions - plan
- Credible and coherent: the plan should make sense and believably accomplish the objective. No conflicts
- Should be a clear diagnosis of the biggest problem to solve

## Understand which problem you're looking to solve for which group of people

- Understand which problems suit your unique strength and weaknesses. 

> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. Of you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. Of you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. (The Art of War, Sun Tzu)

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually at proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1000 things. (Steve Jobs)
