# Good Strategy, Bad strategy
## By Richard Rumelt
Strategy is not a goal or slogan, it should not only defined the end state, but also provide execution plan of how this goal must be achieved.

The essential component of the strategy is a kernel. The kernel consists of three parts: the first two are the diagnosis and the guiding policy.

The diagnosis is a simple analysis of on often complex set of circumstances, and the guiding policy lays out the approach that will be used to tackle this diagnosis.

The final component of the kernel is a set of coherent actions that ensures that the guiding policy is effective. (fitness function)


A good strategy demands that you make a choice to move in one specific direction.

In order to profit from your strategy, you need to ensure that it gives you leverage over your rivals. You anticipate opportunities before your competitors have a chance to act. Anticipation means having an insight into the present that enables you to spot emerging possibilities and act on them.

Find the right balance of resources and actions to fit your specific situation.
You can use the dynamics of changing business circumstances to gain the high ground in a market.

A good strategy maximize your competitive advantage be limiting your rivals' opportunities and maximizing your resources.

Strategy turns vision into reality.

Approach strategy like a science: from a strategic hypothesis to test and then refine your ideas.
Strategic hypotheses - educated estimation of how a given situation works or could work, which help when you contemplate your strategy.
