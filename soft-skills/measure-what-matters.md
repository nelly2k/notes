# :green_book: Measure What Matters
## By John Doerr
Objective Key Result

1 O -> 3-5 KRs
KRs - can be tracked by answering yes/no (achieved, not achieved)

## Defining
There should be handful of organisational OKRs, so everybody in organisation focused on achieving common goal. Once management identifies top level objective, 3-5 KRs are needed per objective. The clear timeframe is required - every quarter is recommended.

Every team should align their OKR with organisational OKR.

Less is more, clear and understandable ORK are more attainable. 

## Tracking
OKR should be constantly tracking, for example on a monthly meetings. (or retro)

OKR life cycle - 4 options are available to OKR contributors: continue, update, start, stop. If an objective if on track, it kame sense to continue it. However, if external condition have made key result unobtainable, then it's best to update them to meet new realities.

It might even be necessary to start a new OKR in the middle of the quarter (or deprecate/cancel one).
Google uses 0-1.0 color-coded scale that enables OKR contributors to assess how successfully they've completed key results. 0.0-0.3 (red :heart:) means no progress, 0.4-0.6 (yellow :yellow_heart:) in progress, 0.7-1.0 (green :green_heart:) - successfully attained.

## Stretch goals
As soon as OKR defined, aligned and tracked, a high-risk challenges can be undertaken. Stretch goals are OKRs that are daunting challenge to OKR contributors. There are separation committed objective and stretch objectives. 

__Committed objective__ usually have to do with day-to-day metrics (should have 100% success rate). __Stretch objective__ is a big picture goals (up to 40% unsuccessful). As there significant risk, you should have backup plan or enough cash to cover fails. 

> Coupling OKRs with continues performance management will help bring about a transparent, healthy workplace culture.

## CFR
__CFRs__ - continuous performance management

CFRs are the OKRs of the HR world, and are all about having conversations with employees that entail both feedback and recognition. 

Organisations that treat their employees as partners, not subordinates, tend to be the most successful.
