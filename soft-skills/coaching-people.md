# When to coach
## Observing
### 1. Prepare preliminary questions
- What is the person doing or not doing effectively?
- What the effect does the person's behaviour have on achieving your group's goals or individual objectives?
- What the effect does the behaviour have on other team's members?

### 2. Avoid premature judgement.
You are trying to be neutral observer.

### 3. Reflect on your observations. 
Does coaching can resolve an issue? Is the problem lies with this person, or with other person or with the team itself?

### 4. Test your theories
Might want to discuss with trusted colleague. 

### 5. Examine your own motives
- Unrealistic expectations - don't compare with yourself
- Interfering feelings - is there anything else influencing your attitude
- Failing to listen - some people fail to deliver their view, however we can do our own observations. Use active listening, read body language.
- Failing to praise. "Have I remember to give positive feedback?"
- Acting on your words. 

### 6. Reality check
Confirm your thoughts with trusted peer

### 7. Discuss your observations with coachee.

# Coaching tools
