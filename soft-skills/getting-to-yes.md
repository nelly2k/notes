## Negotiating an Agreement Without Giving In
### By Roger Fisher, William Ury & Bruce Patton

## Why positional bargaining is bad.

	1. Produces unwise outcome, because you aren't communicate the underlying needs
	2. Inefficient. People stick with position, rather than solving real issue.
	3. Endangers relationships. 

## Principled negotiation
### Separate the people from the problem. 

People affected by emotions, personal problems and experiences basis. People problem should be addressed by its own.

It is ok to allow your negotiation partner to let stem go. 

There are two types of interests: substance, relationship

> Look, we're both businessman. Unless I try to satisfy your interests, we are hardly lie to reach an agreements that satisfies mine, and vice versa. Let's look together at the problem of how to satisfy you collective interests.

## Focus on interests, not positions.
1. For every interest there usually exists several possible positions that could satisfy it
2. Behind opposed positions lie many more shared and compatible interests than conflicting ones

### Identify interests
- Ask why
- Put yourself in the other side's shoes
- Realize that each side has multiple interests
- The most powerful interests are basic human needs: security, economic wellbeing, a sense of belonging, recognition, control

### Invent multiple options looking for mutual gains before deciding what to do.
- Have special brainstorming session
- Broaden your opinion
- Look for mutual gain
- Try to make decision easy for the other side
### Insist that the result be based on some objective standard.
Look for standards, so the result should be fair for both sides.

You want a high price and I want a low one, let's figure out what a fair price would be. What objective standards might be most relevant? How did you determine your price?
	
	
#BATNA
Best alternative to a negotiated agreement, backup plan.
1. Protect yourself by developing aa BATNA. What you would do if you fail to reach an agreement – and use it as the standard against which any proposed agreement is measured. BATNA should be real, fully explored and ready to be actioned.
2. Formulate a trip wire. Before accepting any agreement worse than this trip-wire package, you should take a break and re-examine the situation.

__The better you BATNA, the greater you power.__

## What to do if the other sides is persistent on positional bargaining.

Use "negotiation jiujitsu"

	• Neither reject not accept their positions but rather ask them how they think if addresses the problem at hand  in order to extract interests.
	• Hypothetically discuss the outcomes they are suggesting to direct attention to invention more options
	• Don't defend your ides; invite criticism and advice
