# Cloud Adoption Framework

## Paths to Modernization
- Re-host -> "Lift and shift", Forklift as-is from the data center. e.g. Move on-prem MySQL database to EC2 instance
- Re-Platform :star: :star: -> "Lift and Reshape", Forklift with small modifications. Enable auto-scale, multi-region. Small tweaks. e.g. Migrate on-prem MySQL database to RDS MySQL
- Re-purchase -> "Drop and Shop", abandon existing and purchase new. Example. Migrate legacy on-prem CRM system to salesforce.com
- Re-factor -> break up the monolith. Setting up yourself to long-term success.
- Re-invent, Re-architect :star: :star: :star: -> Serverless, microservices...
- Retire -> get rid of application which are not needed.
- Retain -> Do nothing.
