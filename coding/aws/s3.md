# Security
Buckets created as private by default
Access controls by using:
- Bucket policies - at bucket level
- Access Control Lists - at object level

# Encryption
- In transit (SSl/TSL) - use https to download
- At Rest  - Server Side Encryption 
    - **SSE-S3** s3 managed keys
    - **SSE-KMS**  AWS Key management system
    - **SSE-C** customer provided key
- Client side encryption

If the file is to be encrypted at the upload time, the **x-amz-server-side-encryption** will be included in the request header
- AES256 (SSE-S3)
- aws:kms (SSE-KMS)

If encryption is enforced by bucket policy, then PUT without this header going to be denied.
